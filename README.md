Here are the rules to get you started:

2. Draw a series of underscores on paper or a whiteboard, with each
   underscore representing a letter in the word or phrase.

Guessing Letters:

3. Players take turns guessing letters one at a time.

-If the guessed letter is correct, it's filled into its respective position in the word or phrase.

-If the guessed letter is incorrect, a body part of the "hangman" is drawn (head, body, arms, legs).

Maximum Guesses:

6. Typically, players set a limit of 6 incorrect guesses, but you can adjust this to your preference.

Winning the Game:

The player who thought of the word or phrase wins if the "hangman" figure is completed.
